<h1>What is an XO Activity Bundle? </h1>
<p>The software which defines a &quot;Sugar Activity&quot; is totally contained in a directory and it's subdirectories. The name of this root directory describes the activity and ends with the &quot;.activity&quot; suffix (as an example, the command line activity is contained in the &quot;Terminal.activity&quot; subdirectory). You can examine the Activities and folders within them that are installed  on your machine by clicking on the middle box on the left side of the project page. </p>
<h3>Activity bundles </h3>
For easy distribution and installation, there is a well defined bundling process which creates a zipped image of the files under the activity root, and names the resulting file in the formaat: &lt;some name&gt;&lt;some version number&gt;&quot;.xo&quot;. The software platform on the XO supports the automatic installation of these bundled (or XO zipped files)  into a parent directory that may change from one revision of the operating system to the next. The most recent location of installed directories is &quot;/home/olpc/Activities&quot;.
<p>These activity bundles can come from at least three distinct sources: 

<ol><li type="circle">Many come loaded along with the operating system itself.
<li type="circle">The user can browse the web, and download activities from web sites sponsored by OLPC. The browser that downloads the XO zipped file puts it into the Journal. Then it can be &quot;Resumed&quot; from the journal, which actually unzips and installs it. </li>
</ol>
