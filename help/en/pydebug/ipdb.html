<h1>The IPdb debug commands </h1>
<p>The commands recognized by the debugger are listed in the next<br />
  section.  Most can be abbreviated as indicated; e.g., h(elp) means<br />
  that 'help' can be typed as 'h' or 'help' (but not as 'he' or 'hel',<br />
  nor as 'H' or 'Help' or 'HELP').  Optional arguments are enclosed in<br />
square brackets.</p>
<p>Type &quot;?&quot; at the &lt;ipdb&gt; prompt to get a short reminder of these commands. </p>
<p>Debugger commands<br />
  =================</p>
<p>h(elp)<br />
  Without argument, print the list of available commands.  With<br />
  a command name as argument, print help about that command<br />
  (this is currently not implemented).</p>
<p>w(here)<br />
  Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.<br />
  An arrow indicates the &quot;current frame&quot;, which determines the<br />
  context of most commands.</p>
<p>d(own)<br />
  Move the current frame one level down in the stack trace<br />
  (to a newer frame).</p>
<p>u(p)<br />
  Move the current frame one level up in the stack trace<br />
  (to an older frame).</p>
<p>b(reak) [ ([filename:]lineno | function) [, condition] ]<br />
  With a filename:line number argument, set a break there.  If<br />
  filename is omitted, use the current file.  With a function<br />
  name, set a break at the first executable line of that<br />
  function.  Without argument, list all breaks.  Each breakpoint<br />
  is assigned a number to which all the other breakpoint<br />
  commands refer.</p>
<p> The condition argument, if present, is a string which must<br />
  evaluate to true in order for the breakpoint to be honored.</p>
<p>tbreak [ ([filename:]lineno | function) [, condition] ]<br />
  Temporary breakpoint, which is removed automatically when it<br />
  is first hit.  The arguments are the same as break.</p>
<p>cl(ear) [bpnumber [bpnumber ...] ]<br />
  With a space separated list of breakpoint numbers, clear those<br />
  breakpoints.  Without argument, clear all breaks (but first<br />
  ask confirmation).</p>
<p>disable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]<br />
  Disables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of<br />
  breakpoint numbers.  Disabling a breakpoint means it cannot<br />
  cause the program to stop execution, but unlike clearing a<br />
  breakpoint, it remains in the list of breakpoints and can be<br />
  (re-)enabled.</p>
<p>enable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]<br />
  Enables the breakpoints specified.</p>
<p>ignore bpnumber count<br />
  Sets the ignore count for the given breakpoint number.  If<br />
  count is omitted, the ignore count is set to 0.  A breakpoint<br />
  becomes active when the ignore count is zero.  When non-zero,<br />
  the count is decremented each time the breakpoint is reached<br />
  and the breakpoint is not disabled and any associated<br />
  condition evaluates to true.</p>
<p>condition bpnumber condition<br />
  condition is an expression which must evaluate to true before<br />
  the breakpoint is honored.  If condition is absent, any<br />
  existing condition is removed; i.e., the breakpoint is made<br />
  unconditional.</p>
<p>s(tep)<br />
  Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion<br />
  (either in a function that is called or in the current function).</p>
<p>n(ext)<br />
  Continue execution until the next line in the current function<br />
  is reached or it returns.</p>
<p>unt(il)<br />
  Continue execution until the line with a number greater than the <br />
  current one is reached or until the current frame returns.</p>
<p>r(eturn)<br />
  Continue execution until the current function returns.</p>
<p>run [args...]<br />
  Restart the debugged python program. If a string is supplied it is<br />
  splitted with &quot;shlex&quot;, and the result is used as the new sys.argv.<br />
  History, breakpoints, actions and debugger options are preserved.<br />
  &quot;restart&quot; is an alias for &quot;run&quot;.</p>
<p>c(ont(inue))<br />
  Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.</p>
<p>l(ist) [first [,last]]<br />
  List source code for the current file.<br />
  Without arguments, list 11 lines around the current line<br />
  or continue the previous listing.<br />
  With one argument, list 11 lines starting at that line.<br />
  With two arguments, list the given range;<br />
  if the second argument is less than the first, it is a count.</p>
<p>a(rgs)<br />
  Print the argument list of the current function.</p>
<p>p expression<br />
  Print the value of the expression.</p>
<p>(!) statement<br />
  Execute the (one-line) statement in the context of the current<br />
  stack frame.  The exclamation point can be omitted unless the<br />
  first word of the statement resembles a debugger command.  To<br />
  assign to a global variable you must always prefix the command<br />
  with a 'global' command, e.g.:<br />
  (Pdb) global list_options; list_options = ['-l']<br />
  (Pdb)<br />
</p>
<p>whatis arg<br />
  Prints the type of the argument.</p>
<p>alias [name [command]]<br />
  Creates an alias called 'name' that executes 'command'.  The<br />
  command must *not* be enclosed in quotes.  Replaceable<br />
  parameters can be indicated by %1, %2, and so on, while %* is<br />
  replaced by all the parameters.  If no command is given, the<br />
  current alias for name is shown. If no name is given, all<br />
  aliases are listed.</p>
<p> Aliases may be nested and can contain anything that can be<br />
  legally typed at the pdb prompt.  Note!  You *can* override<br />
  internal pdb commands with aliases!  Those internal commands<br />
  are then hidden until the alias is removed.  Aliasing is<br />
  recursively applied to the first word of the command line; all<br />
  other words in the line are left alone.</p>
<p> A blank line repeats the previous command literally, except for<br />
'list', where it lists the next 11 lines.</p>
<p>Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python<br />
  statements and are executed in the context of the program being<br />
  debugged.  Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation<br />
  point ('!').  This is a powerful way to inspect the program being<br />
  debugged; it is even possible to change variables.  When an exception<br />
  occurs in such a statement, the exception name is printed but the<br />
  debugger's state is not changed.</p>
<p>The debugger supports aliases, which can save typing.  And aliases can<br />
  have parameters (see the alias help entry) which allows one a certain<br />
  level of adaptability to the context under examination.</p>
<p>Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by the<br />
  pair ';;'.  No intelligence is applied to separating the commands; the<br />
  input is split at the first ';;', even if it is in the middle of a<br />
quoted string.</p>
<p>PyDebug puts a file named &quot;.pdbrc&quot;  in your home directory.  
<p>It is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the<br />
  debugger prompt.  This is particularly useful for aliases.  If both<br />
  files exist, the one in the home directory is read first and aliases<br />
  defined there can be overriden by the local file.</p>
<p>Aside from aliases, the debugger is not directly programmable; but it<br />
  is implemented as a class from which you can derive your own debugger<br />
  class, which you can make as fancy as you like.<br />
</p>
<p>As an example, here are two useful aliases that PyDebug <br />
  places in the .pdbrc file:</p>
<p> #Print instance variables (usage &quot;pi classInst&quot;)<br />
  alias pi for k in %1.__dict__.keys(): print &quot;%1.&quot;,k,&quot;=&quot;,%1.__dict__[k]<br />
  #Print instance variables in self<br />
  alias ps pi self<br />
  <br />
  unalias name<br />
  Deletes the specified alias.</p>
<p>q(uit)<br />
  Quit from the debugger.<br />
  The program being executed is aborted.</p>
