<h1>Getting help  </h1>

  <p>The help section of PyDebug is drawn from many web sites and included as a starting point for programmers and learners who do not have continuous access to the internet. It includes useful information and documentation.</p>
  <p>One of the most useful sources of information is the python programs themselves that exist on your XO. The XXX icon on the help page starts up a local html server called pydoc. This will give you summary information and how to interface with all the sugar programs.</p>
<p>For people who have some knowledge of programming, but are new to python, the &quot;DIVE INTO PYTHON&quot; is a short introduction to the python programming language. </p>
