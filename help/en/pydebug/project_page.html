<li><h1>Project Page -- The basic services of the PyDebug</h1>
<img src="images/Screenshot_1_2.jpg" alt="Project Page" border="2" class = "right" />
(See also:<a href="application.html"> Pydebug overview</a>, <a href="../PyDebug.htm">Help Index</a>). The Project Page is divided horizontally into two halves. The left side includes various sources and destinations where you can get program examples and put your modified programs. The right side shows the contents of the activity.info file and the collection of files that make up an Activity. The right side of the screen can be thought of as a sand box or playpen where your program can act, misbehave, and show all its &quot;bugs&quot;. As you develop the python programs that make up your activity you may want to save it fairly often just in case one of your ideas turns out to be a blind alley.
</p>
  <p>The top box on the left side represents the journal. At any time you can save the current state of your collection of programs to the Journal. You do this by clicking on the left arrow between the Journal box and the playpen. The process of creating a bundle is computer intensive and slow, but the end result conserves space on the disk, and bandwidth when the activity is being shared across the network. When you do this, it is saved in a <a href="what_is_an_activity.html">Activity bundle</a> (with a name ending in &quot;.xo&quot;) or a unix archive format (ending with &quot;.tar.gz&quot;). </p>
  <p>The standard XO bundle is the default. The &quot;tar.gz&quot; form will only be used under unusual cirmstances. Perhaps the &quot;activity.info&quot; file, or the startup icon file  is missing, or has some errors.</p>
  <p><img src="images/Screenshot.jpg" alt="journal"  border="2" class="left" /> </p>
  <p>When you click on the right arrow, you are asking the debugger to load an XO file into the workspace. This will replace any activity that is already occupying the workspace. The checksum of the activity that is about to be overwritten will be checked against the checksum stored away the last time the activity was saved. If there have been changes since the last save, a notification will be presented before any changes are lost. </p>
  <img src="images/installed.jpg" alt="Installed Activities" width="399" height="300" border="2" class="right" />
  <p>The middle box, initially labeled &quot;INSTALLED ACTIVITIES:&quot;, is actually located on the XO at /home/olpc/Activities/. This is a list of all the Activities that are loaded on your XO. You can highlight any of these activities and load it into the work area of the debugger. Then if you click on the edit tab, you will find that a few python program files are opened and displayed. The /home/olpc/Activities/ directory, is read-only. You do not have sufficient permissions to write to this location. (Notice that there is only a right arrow shown beside the &quot;installed Activities&quot; box). </p>
  <img src="images/home.jpg" alt="Home " width="399" height="300" border="2" class="left" />
  <p>By clicking the &quot;home&quot; button, the user can switch what the middle box is displayinghe  to &quot;PyDebg Home Storage:&quot;, where storing data is permitted. In Unix computers, this place to store your own files, is sometimes called the &quot;HOME&quot; directory. When your home directory is displayed, the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; arrows are are both visible, and the debugger <img src="images/examples.jpg" alt="Examples" border="2" class="right"  />is able to  copy the full unzipped Activity tree in either direction between the debugger home and the the playpen/sandbox. Limited only by your total disk space you can keep any number of activity trees in your home directory. The &quot;home&quot; button toggles between the &quot;installed&quot; directory and the &quot;home&quot; directory.</p>
  <h3><a name="examples">Choose Examples as you work through the Tutorials</a></h3>
  <p>The Examples box provides a set of templates and features of the XO which are chosen to be helpful when you are learning about and developing activities. The program examples from James Simmons &quot;Making Sugar Activities&quot; are provided so that they can be loaded and explored as the student is working through the text. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The &quot;PROJECT INFORMATION&quot; for Activity under development is the right side of the screen:<img src="images/Screenshot5.jpg" alt="playpen" border="2" class= "right" />  </p>
  <p>The project name will be used as the first part of the root directory for your activity. In order to function properly, the second part of the root durectory will be set automatically by the debugger to &quot;.activity&quot;. The version is included in the XO file name, and displayed in the journal. It should be changed whenever you make a significant change to your program. </p>
  <p>The Unique ID must be some string of characters that is that: unique. This will be used by the dbus session manager to identify your activity and service it properly. The OLPC developers suggest that you use a url that you own, or the prefix &quot;org.laptop&quot; plus a name that you place in the OLPC git repository. </p>
  <p>To start up properly, using the standard XO session manager, the start-up script needs the name of the module, and the class which will start your activity. This will probably be the class you write which sub-classes the &quot;sugar.activity.activity.Activity&quot; which is the starting point for most activitiies. </p>
  <p>Your activity needs a &quot;SVG&quot; icon to represent it on the desktop (find the file ending in &quot;.svg&quot; in the activity folder for an activity on your XO). This icon is normally created using a vector drawing program like &quot;inkscape&quot;. But for debugging purposes, you can quickly generate a two character icon that is surrounded by the following shapes: (circle, square, diamond, star). If you choose to use this PyDebug-generated icon, it will be named &quot;&lt;the name you put in the Name field&gt;.svg&quot; and the appropriate icon designation will be written to the &quot;activity.info&quot; file. During program development, this icon will probably be sufficient. At some time in the future, when your Activity is almost ready for public release, you may want to create an icon that more directly expresses the function of your Activity. </p>
  <h2>Running programs from the Project Page </h2>
  <p>From the project page, click on the &quot;Run Program&quot; icon. This will have the same effect as if you had first clicked on the &quot;Activity&quot; tab at the upper left, and then on the left-most &quot;Run&quot; icon on that page. Or if your have already changed to the &quot;Activity&quot; tab, you can click on the &quot;run&quot; icon in the upper left corner.</p>
