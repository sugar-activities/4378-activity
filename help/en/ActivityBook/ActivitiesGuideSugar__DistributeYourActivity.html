<h1>Distribute Your Activity
</h1>
<h2>Choose A License
</h2>
<p>Before you give your Activity to anyone you need to choose a license that it will be distributed under.&nbsp; Buying software is like buying a book.&nbsp; There are certain rights you have with a book and others you don't have.&nbsp; If you buy a copy of <em>The DaVinci Code</em> you have the right to read it, to loan it out, to sell it to a used bookstore, or to burn it.&nbsp; You do <em>not</em> have the right to make copies of it or to make a movie out of it.&nbsp; Software is the same way, but often worse.&nbsp; Those long license agreements we routinely accept by clicking a button might not allow you to sell the software when you're done with it, or even give it away.&nbsp; If you sell your computer you may find that the software you bought is only good for that computer, and only while you are the owner of the computer.&nbsp; (You can get good deals on reconditioned computers with no operating system installed for that very reason).
</p>
<p>If you are in the business of selling software you might have to hire a lawyer to draw up a license agreement, but if you're giving away software there are several standard licenses you can choose from for free.&nbsp; The most popular by far is called the <em>General Public License</em>, or GPL.&nbsp; Like the licenses Microsoft uses it allows the people who get your program to do some things with it but not others.&nbsp; What makes it interesting is not what it allows them to do (which is pretty much anything they like) but what it forbids them to do.
</p>
<p>If someone distributes a program licensed under the GPL they are also required to make the source code of the program available to anyone who wants it.&nbsp; That person may do as he likes with the code, with one important restriction: if he distributes a program based on that code he must <em>also</em> license that code using the GPL.&nbsp; This makes it impossible for someone to take a GPL licensed work, improve it, and sell it to someone without giving him the source code to the new version.
</p>
<p>While the GPL is not the only license available for Activities to be distributed on <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org">http://activities.sugarlabs.org</a>&nbsp; all the licenses require that anyone getting the Activity also gets the complete source code for it.&nbsp; You've already taken care of that requirement by putting your source code in Gitorious.&nbsp; If you used any code from an existing Activity licensed with the GPL you <em>must</em> license your own code the same way.&nbsp; If you used a significant amount of code from this book (which is also GPL licensed) you may be required to use the GPL too.
</p>
<p>Is licensing something you should worry about?&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; The only reason you'd want to use a license other than the GPL is if you wanted to sell your Activity instead of give it away.&nbsp; Consider what you'd have to do to make that possible:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You'd have to use some language other than Python so you could give someone the program without giving them the source code.</li>
  <li>You would have to have your own source code repository not available to the general public and make arrangements to have the data backed up regularly.</li>
  <li>You would have to have your own website to distribute the Activity.&nbsp; The website would have to be set up to accept payments somehow.
  <br /></li>
  <li>You would have to advertise this website somehow or nobody would know your Activity existed.</li>
  <li>You would have to have a lawyer draw up a license for your Activity.</li>
  <li>You would have to come up with some mechanism to keep your customers from giving away copies of your Activity.</li>
  <li>You would have to create an Activity so astoundingly clever that nobody else could make something similar and give it away.</li>
  <li>You would have to deal with the fact that your "customers" would be children with no money or credit cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org">activities.sugarlabs.org</a>&nbsp; is not the <em>iPhone App Store</em>.&nbsp; It is a place where programmers share and build upon each other's work and give the results to children for free.&nbsp; The GPL encourages that to happen, and I recommend that you choose that for your license.
  <br />
</p>
<h2>Add License Comments To Your Python Code
</h2>
<p>At the top of each Python source file in your project (except <strong>setup.py</strong>, which is already commented) put comments like this:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<pre># <em>filename</em>    <em>Program description</em>
#
# Copyright (C) 2010 <em>Your Name Here</em>
#
# This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
# the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
# (at your option) any later version.
#
# This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
# but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
# GNU General Public License for more details.
#
# You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
# along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
# Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
</pre>
<p> If the code is based on someone else's code you should mention that as a courtesy.
</p>
<h2>Create An .xo File
</h2>
<p>Make certain that activity.info has the version number you want to give your Activity (currently it must be a positive integer) and run this command:
</p>
<pre>./setup.py dist_xo</pre>
<p> This will create a <strong>dist</strong> directory if one does not exist and put a file named something like <strong>ReadETextsII-1.xo</strong> in it.&nbsp; The "1" indicates version 1 of the Activity.
  <br />
</p>
<p>If you did everything right this <strong>.xo</strong> file should be ready to distribute.&nbsp; You can copy it to a thumb drive and install it on an XO laptop or onto another thumb drive running <em>Sugar on a Stick</em>.&nbsp; You probably should do that before distributing it any further.&nbsp; I like to live with new versions of my Activities for a week or so before putting them on <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org">activities.sugarlabs.org.</a>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Now would be a good time to add <strong>dist</strong> to your <strong>.gitignore</strong> file, then commit it and push it to Gitorious.&nbsp; You don't want to have copies of your .xo files in Git.&nbsp; Another good thing to do at this point would be to tag your Git repository with the version number so you can identify which code goes with which version.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre>git tag -m "Release 1" v1 HEAD
git push --tags
</pre>
<h2>Add Your Activity To ASLO
  <br />
</h2>
<p>When you're ready to post the .xo file on ASLO you'll create an account as you did with the other websites.&nbsp; When you've logged in there you'll see a <strong>Tools</strong> link in the upper right corner of the page. Click on that and you'll see a popup menu with an option for <strong>Developer Hub</strong>, which you should click on.&nbsp; That will take you to the pages where you can add new Activities.&nbsp; The first thing it asks for when setting up a new Activity is what license you will use.&nbsp; After that you should have no problem getting your Activity set up.
</p>
<p>You will need to create an Activity icon as a .gif file and create screen shots of your Activity in action.&nbsp; You can do both of these things with <em>The GIMP</em> (GNU Image Manipulation Program).&nbsp; For the icon all you need to do is open the .svg file with The GIMP and <strong>Save As</strong> a .gif file.
</p>
<p>For the screen shots use sugar-emulator to display your Activity in action, then use the <strong>Screenshot</strong> option from the <strong>Create</strong> submenu of the <strong>File</strong> menu with these options:
</p>
<p><img alt="gimp1.jpg" src="ActivitiesGuideSugar/gimp1.jpg" height="346" width="358" />
</p>
<p>This tells GIMP to wait 10 seconds, then take a screenshot of the window you click on with the mouse.&nbsp; You'll know that the 10 seconds are up because the mouse pointer will change shape to a plus (+) sign.&nbsp; You also tell it <em>not</em> to include the window decoration (which means the window title bar and border).&nbsp; Since windows in Sugar do not have decorations eliminating the decorations used by sugar-emulator will give you a screenshot that looks exactly like a Sugar Activity in action.
</p>
<p>Every Activity needs one screenshot, but you can have more if you like.&nbsp; Screenshots help sell the Activity and instruct those who will use it on what the Activity can do.&nbsp; Unfortunately, ASLO cannot display pictures in a predictable sequence, so it is not suited to displaying steps to perform.
</p>
<p> Another thing you'll need to provide is a home page for your Activity.&nbsp; The one for <strong>Read Etexts</strong> is here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Read_Etexts">http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Read_Etexts</a>
  <br />
</p>
<p>Yes, one more website to get an account for.&nbsp; Once you do you can specify a link with <em>/go/Activities/some_name</em> and when you click on that link the Wiki will create a page for you.&nbsp; The software used for the Wiki is MediaWiki, the same as used for Wikipedia.&nbsp; Your page does not need to be as elaborate as mine is, but you definitely should provide a link to your source code in Gitorious.
