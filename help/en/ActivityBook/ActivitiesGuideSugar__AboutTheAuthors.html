<h1>About The Authors
  <br />
</h1>
<h2>James Simmons
  <br />
</h2>
<p><strong>James Simmons</strong> has programmed professionally since 1978.&nbsp; Back then computer programs were made using a special machine that punched holes into cards, reels of tape were the most common data storage medium, and hard disks were so expensive and exotic that the hard disk inventory of a Fortune 500 company would today be considered barely large enough to hold a nice picture of Jessica Alba.
</p>
<p>The industry has come a long way since then, and to a lesser extent so has James.
  <br />
</p>
<p>James learned to program at Oakton Community College in Morton Grove, Illinois and Western Illinois University in Macomb, Illinois.&nbsp; Times were hard back then and a young man's best chance of being employed after graduation was to become an Accountant or a Computer Programmer.&nbsp; It was while he attended OCC that James saw a Monty Python sketch about an Accountant who wished to become a Lion Tamer.&nbsp; This convinced James that he should become a Computer Programmer.
</p>
<p>The year before he attended WIU was named one of the top party schools in the country by <em>Playboy</em> magazine.&nbsp; James was too busy being a computer nerd to find out if it still was.&nbsp; His studies got off to a rough start when he signed up for Basic Assembly Language as his first real computer class, erroneously thinking that the word "Basic" meant "for beginners".&nbsp; He barely passed the course with a "D" but in the process learned that he enjoyed programming computers.&nbsp; He decided to continue his computer studies and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Science.
</p>
<p>James was born in 1956, the year before Sputnik went up.&nbsp; He was a nerdy kid.&nbsp; At various times he fooled around with Erector sets, chemistry sets, microscopes, dissecting kits, model cars, model planes, model rockets, amateur radio, film making, and writing science fiction stories.&nbsp; He achieved no real success with any of these activities.
</p>
<p>James participated in the first <em>Give One Get One</em> promotion of the <em>One Laptop Per Child</em> project and started developing Activities for the Sugar platform soon after.&nbsp; He has written the Activities <strong>Read Etexts</strong>, <strong>View Slides</strong>, and <strong>Get Internet Archive Books</strong>.
</p>

<h2>James Cameron
</h2>
<p> <strong>James Cameron</strong> has programmed as a child since 1978, and professionally since 1982. &nbsp;He learned on programmable calculators, Apple II, TRS-80, Commodore 64, and then DEC VAX.
  <br />
  <br /> James completed a Bachelor's Degree in Business in 1991, majoring in Management Information Systems. He has worked for electrical engineering and computer manufacturing companies. &nbsp;He became interested in One Laptop Per Child as a volunteer and provided radio range testing in the Australian outback, and is now working for OLPC as System Test Coordinator.
</p>
<p>James reviewed the example code in this book and made many suggestions for improving it.
