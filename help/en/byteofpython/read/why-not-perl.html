		If you didn't know already, Perl is another extremely popular open source interpreted
		programming language.
		
		</p><p>
		
		If you have ever tried writing a large program in Perl, you would have answered this
		question yourself! In other words, Perl programs are easy when they are small and it
		excels at small hacks and scripts to 'get work done'. However, they quickly become
		unwieldy once you start writing bigger programs and I am speaking this out of
		experience of writing large Perl programs at Yahoo!
		
		</p><p>
		
		When compared to Perl, Python programs are definitely simpler, clearer, easier to
		write and hence more understandable and maintainable. I do admire Perl and I do use
		it on a daily basis for various things but whenever I write a program, I always start
		thinking in terms of Python because it has become so natural for me. Perl has undergone
		so many hacks and changes, that it feels like it is one big (but one hell of a) hack.
		Sadly, the upcoming Perl 6 does not seem to be making any improvements regarding this.
		
		</p><p>
		
		The only and very significant advantage that I feel Perl has, is its huge
		<a href="http://cpan.perl.org" target="_top">CPAN</a> library - the Comprehensive Perl Archive
		Network. As the name suggests, this is a humongous collection of Perl modules and it is
		simply mind-boggling because of its sheer size and depth - you can do virtually anything
		you can do with a computer using these modules. One of the reasons that Perl has more
		libraries than Python is that it has been around for a much longer time than Python.
		Maybe I should suggest a port-Perl-modules-to-Python hackathon on
		<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.python" target="_top">comp.lang.python</a> :)
		
		</p><p>
		
		Also, the new <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org" target="_top">Parrot virtual machine</a> is
		designed to run both the completely redesigned Perl 6 as well as Python and other interpreted
		languages like Ruby, PHP and Tcl. What this means to you is that <span class="emphasis"><em>maybe</em></span>
		you will be able to use all Perl modules from Python in the future, so that will give you
		the best of both worlds - the powerful CPAN library combined with the powerful Python
		language. However, we will have to just wait and see what happens.
