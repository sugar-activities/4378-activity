		Before we move on to writing Python programs in source files, we need an editor
		to write the source files. The choice of an editor is crucial indeed.  You have
		to choose an editor as you would choose a car you would buy. A good editor will
		help you write Python programs easily, making your journey more comfortable and
		helps you reach your destination (achieve your goal) in a much faster and safer
		way.
		
		</p><p>
		
		One of the very basic requirements is <span class="bold"><strong>syntax
		highlighting</strong></span> where all the different parts of your Python program are
		colorized so that you can <span class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> your program and visualize its
		running.
		
		</p><p>
		
		If you are using Windows, then I suggest that you use IDLE. IDLE does syntax highlighting
		and a lot more such as allowing you to run your programs within IDLE among other things.
		A special note: <span class="bold"><strong>don't use Notepad</strong></span> - it is a bad choice
		because it does not do syntax highlighting and also importantly it does not support
		indentation of the text which is very important in our case as we will see later. Good
		editors such as IDLE (and also VIM) will automatically help you do this.
		
		</p><p>
		
		If you are using Linux/FreeBSD, then you have a lot of choices for an editor. If you are
		an experienced programmer, then you must be already using <span class="application">VIM</span>
		or <span class="application">Emacs</span>. Needless to say, these are two of the most powerful
		editors and you will be benefitted by using them to write your Python programs. I
		personally use <span class="application">VIM</span> for most of my programs. If you are a
		beginner programmer, then you can use <span class="application">Kate</span> which is one of my
		favorites. In case you are willing to take the time to learn VIM or Emacs, then I highly
		recommend that you do learn to use either of them as it will be very useful for you in
		the long run.
		
		</p><p>
		
		If you still want to explore other choices of an editor, see the comprehensive
		<a href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/PythonEditors" target="_top">list of Python
		editors</a> and make your choice. You can also choose an
		<span class="acronym">IDE</span> (Integrated Development Environment) for Python. See the
		comprehensive <a href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments" target="_top">list of IDEs that support Python</a> for more details. Once you start writing
		large Python programs, IDEs can be very useful indeed.
		
		</p><p>
		
		I repeat once again, please choose a proper editor - it can make writing Python
		programs more fun and easy.
