					Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good
					Python program feels almost like reading English, although very
					strict English! This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its
					greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution
					to the problem rather than the language itself.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Easy to Learn</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with.
					Python has an extraordinarily simple syntax, as already mentioned.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Free and Open Source</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					Python is an example of a <span class="acronym">FLOSS</span>
					(Free/Libré and Open Source Software). In simple terms,
					you can freely distribute copies of this software, read it's
					source code, make changes to it, use pieces of it in new
					free programs, and that you know you can do these things. FLOSS
					is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge.
					This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been
					created and is constantly improved by a community who just want
					to see a better Python.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">High-level Language</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about
					the low-level details such as managing the memory used by your
					program, etc.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Portable</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported (i.e. changed
					to make it work on) to many platforms. All your Python programs can
					work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all
					if you are careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.
					
					</p><p>
					
					You can use Python on Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris,
					OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS,
					Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE
					and even PocketPC !
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Interpreted</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					This requires a bit of explanation.
					
					</p><p>
					
					A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted
					from the source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is
					spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler
					with various flags and options. When you run the program, the
					linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory
					and starts running it.
					
					</p><p><a id="python-vm"></a>
					
					Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary.
					You just <span class="emphasis"><em>run</em></span> the program directly from the source
					code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate
					form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native
					language of your computer and then runs it. All this, actually, makes
					using Python much easier since you don't have to worry about
					compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are
					linked and loaded, etc, etc. This also makes your Python programs
					much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto
					another computer and it just works!
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Object Oriented</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as
					object-oriented programming. In <span class="emphasis"><em>procedure-oriented</em></span>
					languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which
					are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In
					<span class="emphasis"><em>object-oriented</em></span> languages, the program is built
					around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very
					powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to
					big languages like C++ or Java.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Extensible</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to
					have some piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that
					part of your program in C or C++ and then use them from your
					Python program.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Embeddable</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					You can embed Python within your C/C++ programs to give 'scripting'
					capabilities for your program's users.
					
					</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Extensive Libraries</span></dt><dd><p>
					
					The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various
					things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit
					testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, ftp, email, XML,
					XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces),
					Tk, and other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always
					available wherever Python is installed. This is called the 'Batteries
					Included' philosophy of Python.
					
					</p><p>
					
					Besides, the standard library, there are various other high-quality
					libraries such as <a href="http://www.wxpython.org" target="_top">wxPython</a>,
					<a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/twisted" target="_top">Twisted</a>,
					<a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm" target="_top">Python Imaging
					Library</a> and many more.
