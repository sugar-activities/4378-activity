			I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for my
			software <a href="http://www.g2swaroop.net/software/" target="_top">Diamond</a>
			so that I could make the installation easy. I had to choose between
			Python and Perl bindings for the Qt library. I did some research on the web
			and I came across an article where Eric S. Raymond, the famous and respected
			hacker, talked about how Python has become his favorite programming language.
			I also found out that the PyQt bindings were very good compared to Perl-Qt.
			So, I decided that Python was the language for me.
		</p><p>
			Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find any!
			I did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too expensive or were more
			like a reference manual than a guide. So, I settled for the documentation that
			came with Python. However, it was too brief and small. It did give a good idea
			about Python but was not complete. I managed with it since I had previous
			programming experience, but it was unsuitable for newbies.
		</p><p>
			About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the (then) latest
			Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. I got excited about it and
			suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff on Python. I started writing a few
			pages but it quickly became 30 pages long. Then, I became serious about making it
			more useful in a book form. After a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of rewrites, it has
			reached a stage where it has become a useful guide to learning the Python language.
			I consider this book to be my contribution and tribute to the open source community.
		</p><p>
			This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still consider it in the
			same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to make it more palatable to others :)
		</p><p>
			In the true spirit of open source, I have received lots of constructive suggestions,
			criticisms and <a href="feedback.html" title="Feedback">feedback</a> from enthusiastic readers
			which has helped me improve this book a lot.
