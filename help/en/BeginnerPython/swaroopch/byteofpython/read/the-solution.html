				</pre><p>
				
				Now, we are in the <span class="bold"><strong>testing</strong></span> phase where
				we test that our program works properly. If it doesn't behave as
				expected, then we have to <span class="bold"><strong>debug</strong></span> our
				program i.e. remove the <span class="emphasis"><em>bugs</em></span> (errors) from the
				program.
				
				</p></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id3069350"></a>How It Works</h4></div></div></div><p>
				
				You will notice how we have converted our <span class="emphasis"><em>design</em></span> into
				<span class="emphasis"><em>code</em></span> in a step-by-step manner.
				
				</p><p>
				
				We make use of the <code class="literal">os</code> and <code class="literal">time</code>
				modules and so we import them. Then, we specify the files and directories
				to be backed up in the <code class="varname">source</code> list. The target directory
				is where store all the backup files and this is specified in the
				<code class="varname">target_dir</code> variable. The name of the zip archive that
				we are going to create is the current date and time which we fetch using the
				<code class="function">time.strftime()</code> function. It will also have the
				<code class="filename">.zip</code> extension and will be stored in the
				<code class="varname">target_dir</code> directory.
				
				</p><p>
				
				The <code class="function">time.strftime()</code> function takes a specification
				such as the one we have used in the above program. The <code class="literal">%Y</code>
				specification will be replaced by the year without the cetury. The
				<code class="literal">%m</code> specification will be replaced by the month as a
				decimal number between  <code class="literal">01</code> and <code class="literal">12</code> and
				so on. The complete list of such specifications can be found in the
				[<span class="citation">Python Reference Manual</span>] that comes with your Python
				distribution. Notice that this is similar to (but not same as) the
				specification used in <code class="literal">print</code> statement (using the
				<code class="literal">%</code> followed by tuple).
				
				</p><p>
				
				We create the name of the target zip file using the addition operator
				which <span class="emphasis"><em>concatenates</em></span> the strings i.e. it joins the
				two strings together and returns a new one. Then, we create a string
				<code class="varname">zip_command</code> which contains the command that we are
				going to execute. You can check if this command works by running it on
				the shell (Linux terminal or DOS prompt).
				
				</p><p>
				
				The <span><strong class="command">zip</strong></span> command that we are using has some options
				and parameters passed. The <code class="option">-q</code> option is used to indicate
				that the zip command should work <span class="bold"><strong>q</strong></span>uietly.
				The <code class="option">-r</code> option specifies that the zip command should work
				<span class="bold"><strong>r</strong></span>ecursively for directories i.e. it
				should include subdirectories and files within the subdirectories as well.
				The two options are combined and specified in a shorter way as
				<code class="option">-qr</code>. The options are followed by the name of the zip archive
				to create followed by the list of files and directories to backup. We
				convert the <code class="varname">source</code> list into a string using the
				<code class="methodname">join</code> method of strings which we have already seen
				how to use.
				
				</p><p>
				
				Then, we finally <span class="emphasis"><em>run</em></span> the command using the
				<code class="function">os.system</code> function which runs the command as if it
				was run from the <span class="emphasis"><em>system</em></span> i.e. in the shell - it returns
				<code class="literal">0</code> if the command was successfully, else it returns an
				error number.
				
				</p><p>
				
				Depending on the outcome of the command, we print the appropriate message
				that the backup has failed or succeeded and that's it, we have created a
				script to take a backup of our important files!
				
				</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note to Windows Users</h3><p>
					
					You can set the <code class="varname">source</code> list and
					<code class="varname">target</code> directory to any file and directory names
					but you have to be a little careful in Windows. The problem is that
					Windows uses the backslash (<code class="literal">\</code>) as the directory
					separator character but Python uses backslashes to represent
					escape sequences!
					
					</p><p>
					
					So, you have to represent a backslash itself using an escape
					sequence or you have to use raw strings. For example, use
					<code class="literal">'C:\\Documents'</code> or <code class="literal">r'C:\Documents'</code>
					but do <span class="bold"><strong>not</strong></span> use
					<code class="literal">'C:\Documents'</code> - you are using an unknown
					escape sequence <code class="literal">\D</code> !
					
					</p></div><p>
				
				Now that we have a working backup script, we can use it whenever we want
				to take a backup of the files. Linux/Unix users are advised to use the
				<a href="executable-python-programs.html" title="Executable Python programs">executable method</a> as
				discussed earlier so that they can run the backup script anytime anywhere.
				This is called the <span class="bold"><strong>operation</strong></span> phase or the
				<span class="bold"><strong>deployment</strong></span> phase of the software.
				
				</p><p>
				
				The above program works properly, but (usually) first programs do not work
				exactly as you expect. For example, there might be problems if you have not
				designed the program properly or if you have made a mistake in typing the
				code, etc. Appropriately, you will have to go back to the design phase or
				you will have to debug your program.
				
				</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="second-version"></a>Second Version</h3></div></div></div><p>
			
			The first version of our script works. However, we can make some refinements to it
			so that it can work better on a daily basis. This is called the
			<span class="bold"><strong>maintenance</strong></span> phase of the software.
			
			</p><p>
			
			One of the refinements I felt was useful is a better file-naming mechanism - using
			the <span class="emphasis"><em>time</em></span> as the name of the file within a directory with the
			current <span class="emphasis"><em>date</em></span> as a directory within the main backup directory.
			One advantage is that your backups are stored in a hierarchical manner and therefore
			it is much easier to manage. Another advantage is that the length of the filenames
			are much shorter this way. Yet another advantage is that separate directories will
			help you to easily check if you have taken a backup for each day since the
			directory would be created only if you have taken a backup for that day.

				Most of the program remains the same. The changes is that we check if there
				is a directory with the current day as name inside the main backup

				exist, we create it using the <code class="function">os.mkdir</code> function.
				
				</p><p>
				
				Notice the use of <code class="varname">os.sep</code> variable - this gives the

				in Windows and <code class="literal">':'</code> in Mac OS. Using

			The second version works fine when I do many backups, but when there are lots of
			backups, I am finding it hard to differentiate what the backups were for! For
			example, I might have made some major changes to a program or presentation,
			then I want to associate what those changes are with the name of the zip archive.
			This can be easily achieved by attaching a user-supplied comment to the name of
			the zip archive.

				<span class="bold"><strong>This program does not work!</strong></span>.
				Python says there is a syntax error which means that the script
				does not satisfy the structure that Python expects to see.
				When we observe the error given by Python, it also tells us the
				place where it detected the error as well. So we start
				<span class="emphasis"><em>debugging</em></span> our program from that line.
				
				</p><p>
				
				On careful observation, we see that the single logical line has
				been split into two physical lines but we have not specified that
				these two physical lines belong together. Basically, Python has
				found the addition operator (<code class="literal">+</code>) without any
				operand in that logical line and hence it doesn't know how to
				continue. Remember that we can specify that the logical line continues
				in the next physical line by the use of a backslash at the end of the
				physical line. So, we make this correction to our program. This is
				called <span class="bold"><strong>bug fixing</strong></span>.

				This program now works! Let us go through the actual enhancements that we
				had made in version 3. We take in the user's comments using the
				<code class="function">raw_input</code> function and then check if the user actually
				entered something by finding out the length of the input using the
				<code class="function">len</code> function. If the user has just pressed
				<span><strong class="keycap">enter</strong></span> for some reason (maybe it was just a routine backup
				or no special changes were made), then we proceed as we have done before.
				
				</p><p>
				
				However, if a comment was supplied, then this is attached to the name of
				the zip archive just before the <code class="filename">.zip</code> extension.
				Notice that we are replacing spaces in the comment with underscores - this
				is because managing such filenames are much easier.

			The fourth version is a satisfactorily working script for most users, but there is
			always room for improvement. For example, you can include a

			passed to the script at the command line. We will get these from the
			<code class="varname">sys.argv</code> list and we can add them to our
			<code class="varname">source</code> list using the <code class="methodname">extend</code> method
			provided by the <code class="classname">list</code> class.
			
			</p><p>
			
			One refinement I prefer is the use of the <span><strong class="command">tar</strong></span> command instead
			of the <span><strong class="command">zip</strong></span> command. One advantage is that when you use the
			<span><strong class="command">tar</strong></span> command along with <span><strong class="command">gzip</strong></span>, the backup is
			much faster and the backup created is also much smaller. If I need to use this
			archive in Windows, then <span class="application">WinZip</span> handles such
			<code class="filename">.tar.gz</code> files easily as well. The <span><strong class="command">tar</strong></span>
			command is available by default on most Linux/Unix systems. Windows users can
			<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tar.htm" target="_top">download</a>
			and install it as well.
			
			</p><p>
			
			The command string will now be:
			
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
			
tar = <span class="py-string">'tar -cvzf %s %s -X /home/swaroop/excludes.txt'</span> % (target, <span class="py-string">' '</span>.join(srcdir))
			
			</pre><p>
			
			The options are explained below.
			
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
					
					<code class="option">-c</code> indicates <span class="bold"><strong>c</strong></span>reation
					of an archive.
					
					</p></li><li><p>
					
					<code class="option">-v</code> indicates <span class="bold"><strong>v</strong></span>erbose
					i.e. the command should be more talkative.
					
					</p></li><li><p>
					
					<code class="option">-z</code> indicates the g<span class="bold"><strong>z</strong></span>ip
					filter should be used.
					
					</p></li><li><p>
					
					<code class="option">-f</code> indicates <span class="bold"><strong>f</strong></span>orce
					in creation of archive i.e. it should replace if there is a file
					by the same name already.
					
					</p></li><li><p>
					
					<code class="option">-X</code> indicates a file which contains a list of filenames
					which must be e<span class="bold"><strong>x</strong></span>cluded from the backup.
					For example, you can specify <code class="literal">*~</code> in this file to not
					include any filenames ending with <code class="literal">~</code> in the backup.
					
					</p></li></ul></div><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
				
				The most preferred way of creating such kind of archives would be using
				the <code class="literal">zipfile</code> or <code class="literal">tarfile</code> module
				respectively. They are part of the Python Standard Library and available
				for you to use already. Using these libraries also avoids the use of the
				<code class="function">os.system</code> which is generally not advisable to use
				because it is very easy to make costly mistakes using it.
				
				</p><p>
				
				However, I have been using the <code class="function">os.system</code> way of
				creating a backup purely for pedagogical purposes, so that the example
				is simple enough to be understood by everybody but real enough to be
				useful.
