		One of the major benefits of object oriented programming is
		<span class="bold"><strong>reuse</strong></span> of code and one of the ways this is achieved is
		through the <span class="emphasis"><em>inheritance</em></span> mechanism. Inheritance can be best imagined as
		implementing a <span class="emphasis"><em>type and subtype</em></span> relationship between classes.
		
		</p><p>
		
		Suppose you want to write a program which has to keep track of the teachers and students in
		a college. They have some common characteristics such as name, age and address. They also
		have specific characteristics such as salary, courses and leaves for teachers and,
		marks and fees for students.
		
		</p><p>
		
		You can create two independent classes for each type and process them but adding a new
		common characteristic would mean adding to both of these independent classes. This quickly
		becomes unwieldy.
		
		</p><p>
		
		A better way would be to create a common class called <code class="classname">SchoolMember</code>
		and then have the teacher and student classes <span class="emphasis"><em>inherit</em></span> from this
		class i.e. they will become sub-types of this type (class) and then we can add specific
		characteristics to these sub-types.
		
		</p><p>
		
		There are many advantages to this approach. If we add/change any functionality in
		<code class="classname">SchoolMember</code>, this is automatically reflected in the subtypes as
		well. For example, you can add a new ID card field for both teachers and students by simply
		adding it to the SchoolMember class. However, changes in the subtypes do not affect other
		subtypes. Another advantage is that if you can refer to a teacher or student object as a
		<code class="classname">SchoolMember</code> object which could be useful in some situations such as
		counting of the number of school members. This is called
		<span class="bold"><strong>polymorphism</strong></span> where a sub-type can be substituted in any
		situation where a parent type is expected i.e. the object can be treated as an instance of
		the parent class.
		
		</p><p>
		
		Also observe that we <span class="emphasis"><em>reuse</em></span> the code of the parent class and we do not
		need to repeat it in the different classes as we would have had to in case we had used
		independent classes.
		
		</p><p>
		
		The <code class="classname">SchoolMember</code> class in this situation is known as the
		<span class="emphasis"><em>base class</em></span> or the <span class="emphasis"><em>superclass</em></span>. The
		<code class="classname">Teacher</code> and <code class="classname">Student</code> classes are called the
		<span class="emphasis"><em>derived classes</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>subclasses</em></span>.
		
		</p><p>
		
		We will now see this example as a program.

				To use inheritance, we specify the base class names in a tuple following
				the class name in the class definition. Next, we observe that the
				<code class="methodname">__init__</code> method of the base class is explicitly
				called using the <code class="varname">self</code> variable so that we can initialize
				the base class part of the object. This is very important to remember -
				Python does not automatically call the constructor of the base class, you
				have to explicitly call it yourself.
				
				</p><p>
				
				We also observe that we can call methods of the base class by prefixing
				the class name to the method call and then pass in the
				<code class="varname">self</code> variable along with any arguments.
				
				</p><p>
				
				Notice that we can treat instances of <code class="classname">Teacher</code> or
				<code class="classname">Student</code> as just instances of the
				<code class="classname">SchoolMember</code> when we use the
				<code class="methodname">tell</code> method of the <code class="classname">SchoolMember</code>
				class.
				
				</p><p>
				
				Also, observe that the <code class="methodname">tell</code> method of the
				subtype is called and not the <code class="methodname">tell</code> method of the
				<code class="classname">SchoolMember</code> class. One way to understand this is that
				Python <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> starts looking for methods in the type, which
				in this case it does. If it could not find the method, it starts looking at the
				methods belonging to its base classes one by one in the order they are specified
				in the tuple in the class definition.
				
				</p><p>
				
				A note on terminology - if more than one class is listed in the inheritance
				tuple, then it is called <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple inheritance</em></span>.
