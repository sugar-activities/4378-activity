	<span class="acronym">FLOSS</span> is based on the concept of a community, which itself is
	based on the concept of sharing, and particularly the sharing of knowledge.
	FLOSS are free for usage, modification and redistribution.
	
	</p><p>
	
	If you have already read this book, then you are familiar with FLOSS as well since
	you have been using <span class="bold"><strong>Python</strong></span> all along!
	
	</p><p>
	
	If you want to know more about FLOSS, you can explore the following list. I have
	listed some big FLOSS as well as those FLOSS which are cross-platform (i.e. work
	on Linux, Windows, etc.) so that you can try using these software without the
	need to switch to Linux immediately <span class="emphasis"><em>although you eventually will
	;-)</em></span>
	
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b>Linux. </b>
				
				This is a FLOSS operating system that the whole world is slowly
				embracing! It was started by Linus Torvalds as a student. Now, it
				is giving competition to Microsoft Windows. The latest 2.6 kernel
				is a major breakthrough w.r.t. speed, stability and scalability.
				[ <a href="http://www.kernel.org" target="_top">Linux Kernel</a> ]
				
				</p></li><li><p><b>Knoppix. </b>
				
				This is a distribution of Linux which runs off just the CD!
				There is no installation required -  you can just reboot your
				computer, pop the CD in the drive and start using a full-featured
				Linux distribution!  You can use all the various FLOSS that comes
				with a standard Linux distribution such as running Python programs,
				compiling C programs, watching movies, etc. Then, reboot your
				computer again, remove the CD and use your existing OS, as if
				nothing happened at all.
				[ <a href="http://www.knopper.net" target="_top">Knoppix</a> ]
				
				</p></li><li><p><b>Fedora. </b>
				
				This is a community-driven distribution, sponsored by Red Hat and is one
				of the most popular Linux distributions. It contains the Linux kernel,
				the KDE, GNOME and XFCE desktops, and the plethora of FLOSS available
				and all this in an easy-to-use and easy-to-install manner.
				
				</p><p>
			
			If you care a complete beginner to Linux, then I would recommend that
			you try <span class="bold"><strong>Mandrake Linux</strong></span> . The newly
			released Mandrake 10.1 is just awesome.
			
			[ <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com" target="_top">Fedora Linux</a>,
			<a href="http://www.mandrakelinux.com" target="_top">Mandrake Linux</a> ]
			
			</p></li><li><p><b>OpenOffice.org. </b>
				
				This is an excellent office suite based on Sun Microsystems' StarOffice
				software. OpenOffice has writer, presentation, spreadsheet and drawing
				components among other things. It can even open and edit MS Word and
				MS PowerPoint files with ease. It runs on almost all platforms. The
				upcoming OpenOffice 2.0 has some radical improvements.
				
				[ <a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_top">OpenOffice</a> ]
				
				</p></li><li><p><b>Mozilla Firefox. </b>
				
				This is <span class="bold"><strong>the</strong></span> next generation web browser
				which is predicted to beat Internet Explorer (in terms of market share only
				;-) in a few years. It is blazingly fast and has gained critical acclaim
				for its sensible and impressive features. The extensions concept allows any
				kind of functionality to be added to it.
				
				</p><p>
			
			It's companion product Thunderbird is an excellent email client that makes
			reading email a snap.
			
			[ <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox" target="_top">Mozilla
			Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird" target="_top">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> ]
			
			</p></li><li><p><b>Mono. </b>
				
				This is an open source implementation of the Microsoft .NET platform.
				It allows .NET applications to be created and run on Linux, Windows,
				FreeBSD, Mac OS and many other platforms as well. Mono implements the
				ECMA standards of the CLI and C# which Microsoft, Intel and HP have
				submitted for standardization and they have now become open standards.
				This is a step in the direction of ISO standardization for the same.
				
				</p><p>
			
			Currently, there is a complete C# <span><strong class="command">mcs</strong></span> (which itself is written
			in C#!), a feature-complete ASP.NET implementation, many ADO.NET providers for
			databases and many many more features that are being improved and added everyday.

			<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net" target="_top">Microsoft .NET</a> ]
			
			</p></li><li><p><b>Apache web server. </b>
				
				This is the popular open source web server. In fact, it is
				<span class="bold"><strong>the</strong></span> most popular web server on the
				planet! It runs nearly 60% of the websites out there. Yes, that's right
				- Apache handles more websites than all the competition (including
				Microsoft IIS) combined.
				
				[ <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_top">Apache</a> ]
				
				</p></li><li><p><b>MySQL. </b>
				
				This is an extremely popular open source database server. It is most famous
				for it's blazing speed. More features are being added to it's latest versions.
				
				[ <a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_top">MySQL</a> ]
				
				</p></li><li><p><b>MPlayer. </b>
				
				This is a video player that can play anything from DivX to MP3 to Ogg
				to VCDs and DVDs to ... who says open source ain't fun? ;-)
				
				[ <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu" target="_top">MPlayer</a> ]
				
				</p></li><li><p><b>Movix. </b>
				
				This is a Linux distribution which is based on Knoppix and runs off the
				CD but is designed to play movies! You can create Movix CDs which are
				just bootable CDs and when you reboot the computer and pop in the CD,
				the movie starts playing by itself! You don't even need a hard disk to
				watch a movie using Movix.
