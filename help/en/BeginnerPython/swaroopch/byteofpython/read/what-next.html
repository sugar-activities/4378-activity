	If you have read this book thoroughly till now and practiced writing a lot of programs, then you
	must have become comfortable and familiar with Python.  You have probably created some Python
	programs to try out stuff and to exercise your Python skills as well. If you have not done it
	already, you should. The question now is 'What Next?'.
	
	</p><p>
	
	I would suggest that you tackle this problem: create your own command-line
	<span class="emphasis"><em>address-book</em></span> program using which you can add, modify, delete or search for
	your contacts such as friends, family and colleagues and their information such as email address
	and/or phone number. Details must be stored for later retrieval.
	
	</p><p>
	
	This is fairly easy if you think about it in terms of all the various stuff that we have come
	across till now. If you still want directions on how to proceed, then here's a hint.
	
	</p><p><b>Hint. (You shouldn't be reading this). </b>
		
		Create a class to represent the person's information. Use a dictionary to store person
		objects with their name as the key. Use the cPickle module to store the objects
		persistently on your hard disk. Use the dictionary built-in methods to add, delete and
		modify the persons.
		
		</p><p>
	
	Once you are able to do this, you can claim to be a Python programmer. Now, immediately send me
	a mail thanking me for this great book ;-) . This step is optional but recommended.
	
	</p><p>
	
	Here are some ways to continue your journey with Python:

		<span class="bold"><strong>GUI</strong></span> Libraries using Python - you need these to create
		your own graphical programs using Python. You can create your own IrfanView or
		Kuickshow or anything like that using the GUI libraries with their Python bindings.
		Bindings are what allow you to write programs in Python and use the libraries which are
		themselves written in C or C++ or other languages.
		
		</p><p>
		
		There are lots of choices for GUI using Python:
		
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b>PyQt. </b>
					
					This is the Python binding for the Qt toolkit which is the foundation
					upon which the KDE is built. Qt is extremely easy to use and very
					powerful especially due to the Qt Designer and the amazing Qt
					documentation. You can use it for free on Linux but you will have to
					pay for it if you want to use it on Windows. PyQt is free if you want
					to create free (GPL'ed) software on Linux/Unix and paid if you want to
					create proprietary software. A good resource on PyQt is
					<a href="http://www.opendocs.org/pyqt/" target="_top">'GUI Programming with
					Python: Qt Edition'</a>. See the
					<a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/index.php" target="_top">official homepage</a> for more details.
					
					</p></li><li><p><b>PyGTK. </b>
					
					This is the Python binding for the GTK+ toolkit which is the
					foundation upon which GNOME is built. GTK+ has many quirks in usage
					but once you become comfortable, you can create GUI apps fast. The
					Glade graphical interface designer is indispensable. The documentation
					is yet to improve. GTK+ works well on Linux but its port to Windows
					is incomplete. You can create both free as well as proprietary software
					using GTK+. See the <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/" target="_top">official
					homepage</a> for more details.
					
					</p></li><li><p><b>wxPython. </b>
					
					This is the Python bindings for the wxWidgets toolkit. wxPython has
					a learning curve associated with it. However, it is very portable
					and runs on Linux, Windows, Mac and even embedded platforms. There
					are many IDEs available for wxPython which include GUI designers as
					well such as <a href="http://spe.pycs.net/" target="_top">SPE (Stani's Python
					Editor)</a> and the
					<a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">wxGlade</a> GUI
					builder. You can create free as well as proprietary software using
					wxPython. See the <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" target="_top">official
					homepage</a> for more details.
					
					</p></li><li><p><b>TkInter. </b>
					
					This is one of the oldest GUI toolkits in existence. If you have used
					<span class="application">IDLE</span>, you have seen a TkInter program at
					work. The documentation for TkInter at <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/tkinter/introduction/index.htm" target="_top">PythonWare.org</a> is comprehensive. TkInter is portable and works
					on both Linux/Unix as well as Windows. Importantly, TkInter is part of
					the standard Python distribution.

			Unfortunately, there is no one standard GUI tool for Python. I suggest that you
			choose one of the above tools depending on your situation. The first factor is
			whether you are willing to pay to use any of the GUI tools. The second factor
			is whether you want the program to run on Linux or Windows or both. The third
			factor is whether you are a KDE or GNOME user on Linux.
			
			</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Future Chapters</h3><p>
				
				I am contemplating writing 1 or 2 chapters for this book on GUI Programming.
				I will be probably be choosing wxPython as the choice of toolkit. If you would
				like to present your views on the subject, please join the
				<a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/byte-of-python" target="_top">byte-of-python mailing list</a> where readers discuss with me on what
				improvements can be made to the book.
