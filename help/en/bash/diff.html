<p>Display the differences between two files, or each corresponding 
  file in two directories. <br>
  Each set of differences is called a "diff" or "patch". For files that are identical, 
  diff normally produces no output; for binary (non-text) files, diff normally 
reports only that they are different.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      diff [<i>options</i>] <i>from-file to-file</i></pre>
<pre>Options</pre><p>Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument) can be combined into a single command line word: so `-ac' is equivalent to `-a -c'.</p> 
<pre>
      -<i>lines</i>  Show <i>lines</i> lines of context. This option is obsolete.

       -a     Treat all files as text and compare  them  line-by-
              line, even if they do not seem to be text.

       -b     Ignore changes in amount of white space.

       -B     Ignore  changes  that  just  insert or delete blank
              lines.

       --brief
              Report only  whether  the  files  differ,  not  the
              details of the differences.

       -c     Use the context output format.

       -C <i>lines</i>
       --context[=<i>lines</i>]
              Use  the  context  output format, showing <i>lines</i> (an
              integer) lines of context, or three if lines is not
              given.  For proper operation, patch typically needs
              at least two lines of context.

       --changed-group-format=<i>format</i>
              Use <i>format</i> to output a line group  containing  dif-
              fering  lines  from both files in if-then-else for-
              mat.

       -d     Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller  set
              of changes.  This makes diff slower (sometimes much
              slower).

       -D <i>name</i>
              Make merged if-then-else format output, conditional
              on the preprocessor macro name.

       -e
       --ed   Make output that is a valid ed script.

       --exclude=<i>pattern</i>
              When comparing directories, ignore files and subdi-
              rectories whose basenames match <i>pattern</i>.

       --exclude-from=<i>file</i>
              When comparing directories, ignore files and subdi-
              rectories  whose  basenames  match any pattern con-
              tained in <i>file</i>.

       --expand-tabs
              Expand tabs to spaces in the  output,  to  preserve
              the alignment of tabs in the input files.

       -f     Make  output  that  looks vaguely like an ed script
              but has changes in the order  they  appear  in  the
              file.

       -F <i>regexp</i>
              In  context  and  unified  format, for each hunk of
              differences, show some of the last  preceding  line
              that matches <i>regexp</i>.

       --forward-ed
              Make  output  that  looks vaguely like an ed script
              but has changes in the order  they  appear  in  the
              file.

       -h     This  option currently has no effect; it is present
              for Unix compatibility.

       -H     Use heuristics to speed  handling  of  large  files
              that have numerous scattered small changes.

       --horizon-lines=<i>lines</i>
              Do  not  discard the last <i>lines</i> lines of the common
              prefix and the first lines lines of the common suf-
              fix.

       -i     Ignore  changes in case; consider upper- and lower-
              case letters equivalent.

       -I <i>regexp</i>
              Ignore changes that just  insert  or  delete  lines
              that match <i>regexp</i>.

       --ifdef=<i>name</i>
              Make merged if-then-else format output, conditional
              on the preprocessor macro <i>name</i>.

       --ignore-all-space
              Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       --ignore-blank-lines
              Ignore changes that just  insert  or  delete  blank
              lines.

       --ignore-case
              Ignore  changes in case; consider upper- and lower-
              case to be the same.

       --ignore-matching-lines=<i>regexp</i>
              Ignore changes that just  insert  or  delete  lines
              that match <i>regexp</i>.

       --ignore-space-change
              Ignore changes in amount of white space.

       --initial-tab
              Output a tab rather than a space before the text of
              a line in normal or context  format.   This  causes
              the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.

       -l     Pass the output through pr to paginate it.

       -L <i>label</i>
       --label=<i>label</i>
              Use <i>label</i> instead of the file name in the context
              format and unified format headers.

       --left-column
              Print only the left column of two common  lines  in
              side by side format.

       --line-format=<i>format</i>
              Use  <i>format</i>  to  output all input lines in in-then-
              else format.

       --minimal
              Change the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller  set
              of changes.  This makes diff slower (sometimes much
              slower).

       -n     Output RCS-format diffs; like -f except  that  each
              command specifies the number of lines affected.

       -N
       --new-file
              In directory comparison, if a file is found in only
              one directory, treat it as present but empty in the
              other directory.

       --new-group-format=<i>format</i>
              Use  <i>format</i>  to  output a group of lines taken from
              just the second file in if-then-else format.

       --new-line-format=<i>format</i>
              Use <i>format</i> to output a line  taken  from  just  the
              second file in if-then-else format.

       --old-group-format=<i>format</i>
              Use  <i>format</i>  to  output a group of lines taken from
              just the first file in if-then-else format.

       --old-line-format=<i>format</i>
              Use <i>format</i> to output a line  taken  from  just  the
              first file in if-then-else format.

       -p     Show which C function each change is in.

       -P     When  comparing directories, if a file appears only
              in the second directory of the  two,  treat  it  as
              present but empty in the other.

       --paginate
              Pass the output through pr to paginate it.

       -q     Report  only  whether  the  files  differ,  not the
              details of the differences.

       -r     When comparing directories, recursively compare any
              subdirectories found.

       --rcs  Output  RCS-format  diffs; like -f except that each
              command specifies the number of lines affected.

       --recursive
              When comparing directories, recursively compare any
              subdirectories found.

       --report-identical-files
       -s     Report when two files are the same.

       -S <i>file</i>
              When  comparing  directories,  start  with the file
              <i>file</i>.  This is used for resuming an aborted compar-
              ison.

       --sdiff-merge-assist
              Print extra information to help <a href="sdiff.html">sdiff</a>.  sdiff uses
              this option when it runs diff.  This option is  not
              intended for users to use directly.

       --show-c-function
              Show which C function each change is in.

       --show-function-line=<i>regexp</i>
              In  context  and  unified  format, for each hunk of
              differences, show some of the last  preceding  line
              that matches <i>regexp</i>.

       --side-by-side
              Use the side by side output format.

       --speed-large-files
              Use  heuristics  to  speed  handling of large files
              that have numerous scattered small changes.

       --starting-file=<i>file</i>
              When comparing directories,  start  with  the  file
              <i>file</i>.  This is used for resuming an aborted compar-
              ison.

       --suppress-common-lines
              Do not print common lines in side by side format.

       -t     Expand tabs to spaces in the  output,  to  preserve
              the alignment of tabs in the input files.

       -T     Output a tab rather than a space before the text of
              a line in normal or context  format.   This  causes
              the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.

       --text Treat  all  files as text and compare them line-by-
              line, even if they do not appear to be text.

       -u     Use the unified output format.

       --unchanged-group-format=<i>format</i>
              Use <i>format</i> to output a group of common lines  taken
              from both files in if-then-else format.

       --unchanged-line-format=<i>format</i>
              Use <i>format</i> to output a line common to both files in
              if-then-else format.

       --unidirectional-new-file
              When comparing directories, if a file appears  only
              in  the  second  directory  of the two, treat it as
              present but empty in the other.

       -U <i>lines</i>
       --unified[=<i>lines</i>]
              Use the unified output format,  showing  <i>lines</i>  (an
              integer) lines of context, or three if lines is not
              given.  For proper operation, patch typically needs
              at least two lines of context.

       -v
       --version
              Output the version number of diff.

       -w     Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       -W <i>columns</i>
       --width=<i>columns</i>
              Use an output width of <i>columns</i> in side by side for-
              mat.

       -x <i>pattern</i>
              When comparing directories, ignore files and subdi-
              rectories whose basenames match <i>pattern</i>.

       -X <i>file</i>
              When comparing directories, ignore files and subdi-
              rectories whose basenames match  any  pattern  con-
              tained in <i>file</i>.

       -y     Use the side by side output format.</pre>
<p>In the simplest case, diff compares the contents of the two files <i>from-file 
  </i>and <i>to-file</i>. A file name of - stands for text read from the standard 
  input. </p>
<p>If <i>from-file</i> is a directory and <i>to-file </i>is not, 
  diff compares the file in <i>from-file</i> whose file name is that of <i>to-file</i>, 
  and vice versa. The non-directory file must not be -. </p>
<p>If both <i>from-file</i> and <i>to-file </i>are directories, diff 
  compares corresponding files in both directories, in alphabetical order; this 
  comparison is not recursive unless the -r or --recursive option is given. </p>
<p>GNU `diff' can show whether files are different without detailing the differences. 
  <br>
  It also provides ways to suppress certain kinds of differences that are not 
  important to you. <br>
  <br>
  Most commonly, such differences are changes in the amount of white space between 
  words or lines. `diff' also provides ways to suppress differences in alphabetic 
  case or in lines that match a regular expression that you provide. <br>
  <br>
  These options can accumulate; for example, you can ignore changes in both white 
  space and alphabetic case.<b><br>
  <br>
  End -of-Line markers</b><br>
  In operating systems that distinguish between text and binary files, `diff' 
  normally reads and writes all data as text. <br>
  <br>
  Use the `--binary' option to force `diff' to read and write binary data instead. 
  This option has no effect on a Posix-compliant system like GNU or traditional 
  Unix. However, many personal computer operating systems represent the end of 
  a line with a carriage return followed by a newline. <br>
  <br>
  On such systems, `diff' normally ignores these carriage returns on input and 
  generates them at the end of each output line, but with the `--binary' option 
  `diff' treats each carriage return as just another input character, and does 
  not generate a carriage return at the end of each output line. <br>
  <br>
  This can be useful when dealing with non-text files that are meant to be interchanged 
  with Posix-compliant systems.<b><br>
  <br>
Suppress differences in Blank and Tab Spacing</b></p>
<p>  The `-b' and `--ignore-space-change' options ignore white space at line end, 
  and considers all other sequences of one or more white space characters to be 
  equivalent. <br>
  <br>
  The `-w' and `--ignore-all-space' options are stronger than `-b'. They ignore 
  difference even if one file has white space where the other file has none. "White 
  space" characters include tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, 
  and space; some locales may define additional characters to be white space.<br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
Ignore Case</b></p>
<p>GNU `diff' can treat lowercase letters as equivalent to their uppercase counterparts, 
  so that, for example, it considers `Funky Stuff', `funky STUFF', and `fUNKy 
  stuFf' to all be the same. <br>
  To request this, use the `-i' or `--ignore-case' option.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Suppressing Lines Matching a Regular Expression</b><br>
  To ignore insertions and deletions of lines that match a regular expression, 
  use the `-I REGEXP' or `--ignore-matching-lines=REGEXP' option. <br>
  You should escape regular expressions that contain shell metacharacters to prevent 
  the shell from expanding them. <br>
  <br>
  For example, `diff -I '^[0-9]'' ignores all changes to lines beginning with 
  a digit. <br>
  <br>
  However, `-I' only ignores the insertion or deletion of lines that contain the 
  regular expression if every changed line in the hunk--every insertion and every 
  deletion--matches the regular expression. <br>
  <br>
  In other words, for each nonignorable change, `diff' prints the complete set 
  of changes in its vicinity, including the ignorable ones. You can specify more 
  than one regular expression for lines to ignore by using more than one `-I' 
  option. `diff' tries to match each line against each regular expression, starting 
  with the last one given.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Summarizing Which Files Differ</b><br>
  When you only want to find out whether files are different, and you don't care 
  what the differences are, you can use the summary output format. <br>
  In this format, instead of showing the differences between the files, `diff' 
  simply reports whether files differ. <br>
  The `-q' and `--brief' options select this output format. <br>
  This format is especially useful when comparing the contents of two directories. 
  It is also much faster than doing the normal line by line comparisons, because 
  `diff' can stop analyzing the files as soon as it knows that there are any differences. 
  <br>
  You can also get a brief indication of whether two files differ by using `cmp'. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Using diff to patch a file</b><br>
  To show context around the differing lines GNU `diff' provides these output 
  formats <br>
  <br>
  Normal Format: An output format that shows each hunk of differences without 
  any surrounding context<br>
  Context Format:: An output format that shows surrounding lines. <br>
  Unified Format:: A more compact output format that shows context.<br>
  <br>
  `patch' can apply diffs by searching in the files for the lines of context around 
  the differing lines; if those lines are actually a few lines away from where 
  the diff says they are, `patch' can adjust the line numbers accordingly and 
still apply the diff correctly.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p><span class="telety">$ diff -q &lt;(sort file1.txt | uniq) &lt;(sort file2.txt | uniq)</span><br>
  <br>
The command above will return 0 if <span class="telety">file1.txt = file2.txt </span>and will return 1 if <span class="telety">file1.txt &ne; file2.txt</span><br>Note the files have to be sorted first (the order matters) and if the files could contain duplicate values, then the output of sort has to be run through the uniq command to eliminate any duplicate elements. </p>

  editor to edit a file - see `info diff'<br>
